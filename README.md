# Fashion Recommendation Engine 

The goal of this project is to build a fashion recommendation system using deep learning techniques. The system will be able to suggest clothing items to users based on their preferences and past purchase history.

The dataset used for this project will be a large collection of images of clothing items, along with accompanying metadata such as brand, color, and size. The pretraine deep learning Resnet50 model will be trained on this data to learn patterns and relationships between different clothing items and user preferences.

### The project will be divided into several stages:

* Data Collection: The dataset of clothing images and metadata will be collected from various sources, such as e-commerce websites and Kaggle Fashion recommendation dataset.

* Data Preprocessing: The images and metadata will be preprocessed and cleaned to remove any irrelevant or duplicate data. The images will also be resized and normalized for use in the deep learning model.

* Model Development: A deep learning model will be developed to learn patterns and relationships between different clothing items and user preferences. The model will be trained on the preprocessed dataset using techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs).

* Model Evaluation: The performance of the model will be evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. The model will also be tested on a separate test set to ensure that it generalizes well to new data.

* Deployment: Once the model is trained and evaluated, it will be deployed as a web application  where users can input their preferences and receive relevant fashion recommendations.

The final product will be a fashion recommendation system that provides users with personalized clothing recommendations based on their preferences and Similarity Measurement. This system has the potential to revolutionize the way people shop for clothing online, making the process more efficient and enjoyable for users.
